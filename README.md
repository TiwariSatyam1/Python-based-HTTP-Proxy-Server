The project aims to develop a lightweight HTTP-based proxy server using Python.
HTTP proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and web servers, enhancing security, performance, and privacy.
The need for such a proxy server arises from the increasing demand for secure and efficient web browsing.


Objective:
Design and implement an HTTP proxy server capable of handling client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate web servers.
Enhance the server's functionality with features such as caching, logging, and content filtering.
Ensure the proxy server's compatibility with various web protocols and client applications.
